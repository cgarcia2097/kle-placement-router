# KLE Placement Router (KLEPR)

Think 'leper', but with a 'k', and you'd have 90 percent of the pronunciation.

This is a KiCAD plugin written in Python for programatically placing clusters of components onto a PCB from a layout file.

As always, feel free to contribute by posting issues and pull requests.

## What is it not?

What it is not is a **keyboard generator**. That requires programmatic generation of components with minimal human editing. Other projects are better proofs of concepts, such as [MrKeebs Keyboard Builder](https://builder.mrkeebs.com/) and [Jeroen Bouwens klepcbgen](https://github.com/jeroen94704/klepcbgen).
